* Source code for the RP system and papers.

I contacted Dr. MacLennan in Jul 2021 to confirm I had the author
information correct, and he was kind enough to send me the original
=troff= sources for some of the papers, as well as RP source code for
the example programs, and lisp code for the RP interpreter itself.
